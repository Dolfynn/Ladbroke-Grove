Ladbroke Grove
-
-Welcome to Ladbroke Grove born out of a desire to fuse the rich diversity of English slang with the precision of computer programming.

-It breaks away from traditional, often rigid, programming syntaxes, introducing a playful, yet robust language structure that leverages common English slang.

-Our goal is to add an element of fun and relatability, especially for those who find conventional programming languages daunting or monotonous.

-We had a had 2 versions of our programming language, one which was more advanced and complicated, and unfortunately we didn't get to work completely, we didn't have enough time to complete it. So we uploaded our second version which is a bit simpler but works for a few sample cases. Please use this one for testing because the other version wasn't completed.
