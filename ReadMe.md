-Welcome to Ladbroke Grove born out of a desire to fuse the rich diversity of English slang with the precision of computer programming.

-It breaks away from traditional, often rigid, programming syntaxes, introducing a playful, yet robust language structure that leverages common English slang.

-Our goal is to add an element of fun and relatability, especially for those who find conventional programming languages daunting or monotonous.
